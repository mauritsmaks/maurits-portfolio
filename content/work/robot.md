**Inspection Robot [2015-2017]:** Currently, there is no inspection technique meeting all requirements to inspect the 120,000 km of underground drinking water mains in use in the Netherlands. Application of conventional techniques is limited by the many bends and lack of access points in the pipe network, besides the undesired downtime of the system and risk of contamination.
Nevertheless, obtaining detailed data on pipe condition is essential for replacing the right pipe at the right time.
In this project an autonomous inspection robot is proposed, capable of long term stay in the mains, and equipped with on board inspection technologies. Prototyping currently focusses on traveling through the network and robot dimensions.

Check out the latest publication in [Water Matters](http://www.h2o-watermatters.com/?article=2016123 "English publication in Water Matters, december 2016.") with detailed information about our vision on future inspections. This project is a cooperation between [KWR](https://www.kwrwater.nl/ "Bridging science to practice in the watercycle") and [Wetsus](https://www.wetsus.nl/ "European centre of excellence for sustainable water technology") funded by the Dutch drinking water companies.
