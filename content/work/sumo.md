**Sumobot [2010]:** The result of the first year electrical engineering project was a sumo robot capable of pushing other robots out of a marked ring. Multiple teams built robots that demonstrated their capabilities in a final contest.  Maximum allowed weight was 7,5kg and the robots needed to be autonomous.

##### The robot can detect a white line marking the edge on a black floor; it will then turn away from the edge. A distance sensor is used to detect the other robot.

This project work was done at [Windesheim University](https://www.windesheim.nl/studeren/opleidingen/techniek-en-ict/elektrotechniek/ "Windesheim Electrical Engineering website."), together with students from other disciplines: J. Meijers, J. Peters, T. van den Bosch, W. Bekedam, J. van Dorp.

##### The sumobot in battle with another robot. The ramp shape lifts the other robot so it looses traction and can easily be pushed out.

All parts of the robot where developed by ourselves as part of the assignment. The bodywork was made by lasercutting. Printed circuit boards were etched and the robot was tested after assembly.
