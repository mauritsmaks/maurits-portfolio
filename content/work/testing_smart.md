**Testing Smart Textile [2014]:** Use of electronics in textiles creates many possibilities for new applications, not only in the field of clothing but also in house decoration. It is now possible to integrate bio monitoring into clothing for use in healthcare, sports, hazardous professions and many more applications. To get a better insight in the reliability of Smart Textiles (textiles with electronics) samples were made and tested.

##### Typical resistance measurements on the samples show a gradual increase of resistance when subjected to more bends. Tests of 100,000 bending cycles were performed.

For the department of [Smart Functional Materials of Saxion University](https://www.saxion.nl/designentechnologie/site/over/lectoraten/smart/smartfunctionalmaterials_english/ "Smart Functional Materials website.") a testing setup was constructed and Smart Textile samples were made. The rig can be run at night to perform tests and the data can be analyzed afterwards. The size of the machine was chosen to be as large as possible within the limitations of the lasercutter that was used. All parts fit together by clamping, so almost no glue was necessary for the construction.

The Smart Textile samples were constructed with different types of conductive yarns; copper, stainless steel, silver coated nylon. A circuit board was designed to connect the wires by adhesive bonding with the measuring equipment.
