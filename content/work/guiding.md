**Cable Guiding System [2015]:** One of the major problems with tethered pipe inspection is the drag from the cable. This is especially a problem in pipe networks with many bends and T-joints. A bend will exponentially increase the required pulling force on the cable, thus reducing the travel distance.

##### Video showing the prototype Cable Guiding System travelling through a straight pipe and pulling the cable. The system consists of multiple modules, for now the clamp and pulling module are operational.

This design fits the [PIRATE inspection robot](http://inspectierobot.edwindertien.nl/ "PIRATE inspection robot website.") developed at the department of [Robotics and Mechatronics](https://www.ram.ewi.utwente.nl/default.html "The department of Robotics and Mechatronics.") of [Twente University](https://www.utwente.nl/ "The website of University Twente."). It has to fit small pipes 2‚Äù and larger, and must be able to pass T-joints.

##### The clamping module can fit in pipes of different materials and sizes. The clamping mechanism is shown here without the cables and other modules attached.

The Cable Guiding System consists of multiple modules, but to proof the principle only the clamping and cable pulling mechanism were built. The clamping mechanism can clamp in pipes from 51 to 120mm internal diameter. The stainless steel construction of the prototype can withstand the high forces needed to pull the tether cable. The construction was designed in SolidWorks, at bend lines the material was weakened to allow precise bending of the metal by hand.

##### The cable pulling mechanism is designed to pull two cables, one at both sides. It is fitted between other modules, like a clamping module.

The pulling mechanism allows the System to travel along the tether cable in a pipe network. If the clamping mechanism is activated it can no longer travel, but can pull the tether cable through the pipe. All parts which have to withstand high forces are made of bent stainless steel, but the casing is made of 3D-printed plastic to reduce weight.
