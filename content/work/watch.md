**Wrist Watch [2012]:** This stainless steel lassercut Watch was designed to match the  [Skeletool multitool](https://www.leatherman.com/skeletool-18.html "Skeletool Multitool from Leatherman.") from Leatherman. The clockwork in the watch does run, but it is only a mockup to test user interaction and proportions.

##### The Skeletool multitool and the watch, both made of stainless steel and both produced by lasercutting. The clockwork inside the watch is fully functional.

This Watch is multifunctional with hidden functions that are activated when opened. The design focused on hidden function as a speed detector.  Because the parts can move, it is possible to test user interaction on a shape level.

##### User interaction with the watch to reveal a (theoretical) hidden feature. This could activate the built-in radar detector to detect the speed of an object.

Parts were designed in SolidWorks and constructed of sheet metal. The round housing of the watch is turned on a lathe. The metal band was also lassercut to match the design of the Wrist Watch.
