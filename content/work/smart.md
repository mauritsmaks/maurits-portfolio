**Smart Textile [2015]:** Use of electronics in textiles creates many possibilities for new applications, not only on the field of clothing but also house decoration. In clothing it is now possible to integrate bio monitoring, for healthcare, sports, fire fighters and many more professions. Also fashion can use electronics to produce unique items for personal use.

##### Electronics on textile, with wiring, led’s, batteries and microcontroller.

For the department of [Smart Functional Materials of Saxion University](https://www.saxion.nl/designentechnologie/site/over/lectoraten/smart/smartfunctionalmaterials_english/ "Smart Functional Materials website.") a prototype was made to demonstrate electronics on textile. This Smart Textiles demonstrates the possibilities with programmable lighting integrated into the textile.

Main focus in building the prototype was on fixing the wires to the textile and the electrical contact between wires and electronics. Fixing the wires was achieved by encapsulating wires in flexible plastic; first the plastic was applied by 3D-printer. This allowed for precise placement of electronic lines. Secondly continuous stainless steel fibers were manually placed and attached. And in the last step the 3D-printer was used to cover and further attach the fibers.

Adhesive bonding was used to establish an electrical contact between wires and electronics; this was done with thermoplastic glue and pressure. The conductive fibers are pressed against the conductive pads on the Printed Circuit Board, thus creating an electrical connection. This technique has not the lowest resistance, but is extremely simple, allows repairs and does not damage the textile.
