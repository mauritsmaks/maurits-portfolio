**Smart Textile [2015]:** Use of electronics in textiles creates many possibilities for new applications, not only in the field of clothing but also in furniture, house decoration and industry. It is now possible to integrate bio monitoring into clothing for use in healthcare, sports, hazardous professions and many more applications. Smart Textiles also offer new possibilities for the fashion industry, creating unique items for personal use.

##### Electronics on textile, with wiring, led’s, batteries and microcontroller.

For the department of [Smart Functional Materials of Saxion University](https://www.saxion.nl/designentechnologie/site/over/lectoraten/smart/smartfunctionalmaterials_english/ "Smart Functional Materials website.") a prototype was made to demonstrate electronics on textile. This Smart Textile demonstrates some of the possibilities with programmable lighting integrated into the fabric.

Main focus in building the prototype was on attaching the wires to the textile and the electrical contact between wires and electronics. Fixing the wires was achieved by encapsulating wires in flexible plastic; first the plastic was applied by 3D-printer. This allowed for precise placement of electronic lines. Secondly continuous stainless steel fibers were manually placed and attached. And in the last step the 3D-printer was used to cover and attach the fibers.

Adhesive bonding was used to establish an electrical contact between wires and electronics; this was done with temperature and pressure. The conductive fibers were pressed against the conductive pads on the printed circuit board, thus creating an electrical connection. Advantages of this technique are its simplicity, it allows repairs and does not damage the textile.
