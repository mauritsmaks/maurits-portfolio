**Home Energy Monitor [2013]:** To get a better insight in your energy consumption a Home Energy Monitor can be connected to the electricity meter of a house. This is a low cost power usage indicator based on the Arduino platform.

##### Home Energy Monitor on the wall next to the cupboard. Power usage is shown in Watts, but more indicator styles are available.

The Energy Monitor can be assembled with simple tools and no soldering, only minimal experience is needed. An important part is the microcontroller hidden under the display that measures pulses from the electricity meter and drives the display.

##### The electronics inside are composed of basic parts, so others can easily reproduce the Energy Monitor. Minimal knowledge of electronics or programming is needed.

A very simple user input allows different display modes and allows calibration of the electronics. The device has a low energy consumption, and all parts can be recycled. This is possible because soldering is not needed in the assembly.

##### The actual power usage shown in a short movie. Starting with the home standby usage of 88Watts, when a cooker is turned on this increases to 1980Watts and slowly decreases when it is turned off again.
